Projects follow a **trunk-based branching strategy** where development happens directly on the `main` branch. This approach simplifies the workflow and enables faster deployments to project environments.

## Main Branch

- **`main`**: The primary branch for all project changes. All development and deployments happen through this branch.

<Info>
Unlike modules and stacks which use Gitflow with `develop` and `main` branches, projects use a trunk-based approach where `main` is the single source of truth.
</Info>

## Branch Naming Conventions

Projects use release branches for deploying to specific environments. These branches are temporary and are deleted after merging.

### Release Branches

Release branches are used to deploy changes to specific project environments (dev, qa, prd). They follow the format:

**Format**: `release/<project-name>/<env>/<action>`

**Examples**:
- `release/example-project/dev/bump-stack-version`
- `release/example-project/qa/update-tags`
- `release/example-project/prd/add-storage-account`

<Info>
The `<env>` component identifies the target environment (dev, qa, or prd), and `<action>` describes the change being made (e.g., "bump-stack-version", "update-tags", "add-new-resource").
</Info>

### Branch Naming Best Practices

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for multi-word names
- Be descriptive but concise in the action name
- Always include the project name and environment
- Use clear action names that indicate what changes are being made

<Tip>
Descriptive action names help team members quickly understand what changes are being deployed to each environment.
</Tip>

## Workflow Overview

1. Create a release branch from `main` targeting a specific environment
2. Make your changes and validate them through staging
3. Open a pull request to `main`
4. After approval and merge, changes are automatically deployed to the target environment

## Key Differences from Modules & Stacks

| Aspect | Projects | Modules & Stacks |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Strategy** | Trunk-based (main only) | Gitflow (develop + main) |
| **Feature branches** | Not used | Used for new features |
| **Bugfix branches** | Not used | Used for bug fixes |
| **Hotfix branches** | Not used | Used for critical fixes |
| **Release branches** | Used for environment deployments | Used for version releases |

<Warning>
Projects do not use feature, bugfix, or hotfix branches. All changes go through release branches that target specific environments.
</Warning>
