description: "Learn about the automatically generated GitHub Wiki catalog for technical documentation"
---

Each repository includes a **GitHub Wiki** that is **automatically generated** and contains a catalog of all modules, stacks, or projects in the repository. The wiki serves as comprehensive technical documentation for developers working directly with the codebase.

<Info>
The GitHub Wiki is automatically generated from the repository structure and module definitions, ensuring documentation stays in sync with the codebase.

## Page Sections

Each page in the GitHub Wiki follows a consistent format with the following sections:

- **Usage** - Terraform module example showing how to reference and use the component
- **Attributes** - Overview of the component's key attributes and characteristics
- **Requirements** - Required Terraform and provider versions
- **Providers** - Required Terraform providers and their version constraints
- **Modules** - Sub-modules that the component depends on or uses internally
- **Resources** - All Terraform resources created by the component
- **Inputs** - Complete list of input variables with descriptions, types, defaults, and required status
- **Outputs** - All output values provided by the component with descriptions
- **Changelog** - Version history with release dates, version numbers, and associated pull requests
