**Mintlify** (this documentation site) is used for **client-facing documentation**. It provides:

- **Catalog**: Browse available modules, stacks, and deployment templates in an organized, searchable format
- **API Reference**: Complete documentation of API endpoints, parameters, responses, and integration examples
- **DevOps**: Guidelines and best practices for teams adopting this framework.

<Tip>
Mintlify documentation is designed for external users, stakeholders, and teams looking to adopt our infrastructure framework. It focuses on usability and provides deployment templates, while the GitHub Wiki serves as the technical reference for developers working directly with the code.
</Tip>

<Note>
For teams adopting this framework, the Mintlify documentation includes DevOps practices and standards that should be followed to maintain consistency and quality across infrastructure deployments. These docs should be internal if adopted.
