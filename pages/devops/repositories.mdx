Our infrastructure code is organized across three repositories, each serving a specific purpose in the infrastructure-as-code workflow.

## Terraform Modules

The **terraform-modules** repository contains primitive, stateless Terraform modules that serve as the foundational building blocks for all infrastructure.

**Scope:**
- Primitive modules that encapsulate logic
- Tool modules to simplify and standardize stack development
- Examples: `az_storage_account`, `az_key_vault`, `az_rbac_profile_assignment`

<Check>
**Purpose:** Provide standardized, tested modules that encapsulate and provide either a tool for development or an interface to be configured in the stack.
</Check>

## Terraform Stacks

The **terraform-stacks** repository combines modules to create stateless bundles and templates that represent complete infrastructure solutions.

**Scope:**
- **Bundles**: Combines multiple modules into cohesive units (e.g., storage account + private endpoint + alerts + RBAC + tiers)
- **Templates**: Uses bundles to create larger templates (e.g., Omni template = storage bundle + key vault bundle + SQL bundle + size tiers)
- Stateless configurations that can be deployed to any environment
- Examples: `storage_account_stack`, `resource_group_stack`

<Check>
**Purpose:** Provide tiered and ready-to-use infrastructure bundles and templates that combine multiple modules into complete solutions.
</Check>

## Terraform Projects

The **terraform-projects** repository contains environment-specific deployments that use stacks to provision real infrastructure.

**Scope:**
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, qa, prd)
- Deploys stacks to real Azure infrastructure
- Contains variable values and backend configurations for each environment
- Examples: Project configurations for specific applications or services

<Check>
**Purpose:** Manage actual infrastructure deployments by configuring and deploying stacks to specific environments.
</Check>
