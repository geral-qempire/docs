---

We use **env0 GitHub integration** to streamline Terraform workflows and provide seamless infrastructure management directly from GitHub.

## Automated Plans on Pull Requests

The env0 GitHub integration automatically runs Terraform plans when pull requests are opened or updated. This provides:

- **Automatic validation**: Every PR triggers a Terraform plan to validate infrastructure changes
- **Early feedback**: Catch potential issues before merging
- **Plan visibility**: View plan results directly in the GitHub PR interface
- **Cost estimation**: Understand infrastructure cost implications before deployment

<Info>
Terraform plans run automatically for all pull requests, giving you immediate feedback on infrastructure changes without manual intervention.
</Info>

## Direct Apply from GitHub

The env0 integration allows you to apply Terraform changes directly from GitHub:

- **Apply from PR comments**: Trigger applies using GitHub comments or PR actions
- **Approval workflows**: Configure approval requirements for production environments
- **Audit trail**: All applies are tracked and logged for compliance
- **Environment management**: Manage multiple environments (dev, qa, prod) with appropriate controls

<Tip>
Direct apply capabilities streamline the deployment process while maintaining proper controls and audit trails for infrastructure changes.

## Detailed Workflows

For step-by-step workflow procedures, see our detailed workflow documentation:

### Modules & Stacks

- **[Feature Workflow](/devops/modules-stacks/workflow-develop-modules-stacks)**: Complete process for feature and bugfix branches merging into `develop` for modules and stacks
- **[Release Workflow](/devops/modules-stacks/workflow-release-modules-stacks)**: Process for release branches merging into `main` for modules and stacks
- **[Hotfix Workflow](/devops/modules-stacks/workflow-hotfix-modules-stacks)**: Process for hotfix branches merging into `main` for modules and stacks

### Projects

- **[Deploy/Update Workflow](/devops/projects/workflow-deploy-projects)**: Complete workflow for deploying and updating projects to development, quality assurance, and production environments

These workflows cover how to use env0 for plans, applies, and infrastructure management throughout the development lifecycle.
