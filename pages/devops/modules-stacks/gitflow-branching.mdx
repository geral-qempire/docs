We follow the **Gitflow** branching model to manage our development workflow. Gitflow provides a robust framework for managing features, releases, and hotfixes.

## Main Branches

- **`main`**: The production-ready branch. Code in this branch is always deployable and represents the current production state.
- **`develop`**: The integration branch for development. All feature branches are merged here before being released to production.

## Supporting Branches

- **Feature branches**: New functionality developed in isolation
- **Bugfix branches**: Fixes for bugs found in the develop branch
- **Hotfix branches**: Critical fixes that need to be applied directly to production
- **Release branches**: Preparation for a new production release

<Note>
All supporting branches are temporary and should be deleted after merging into their target branches.
</Note>

## Branch Naming Conventions

We use standardized prefixes for branch names to clearly communicate the purpose of each branch. All branch names should follow these conventions:

### Branch Prefixes

- **`feature/`**: New features or enhancements
  - Example: `feature/az_storage_account/add-blob-versioning`

- **`bugfix/`**: Bug fixes for issues in the develop branch
  - Example: `bugfix/az_rbac_profile_assignment/fix-role-assignment`

- **`hotfix/`**: Critical production fixes that bypass the normal development process
  - Example: `hotfix/az_private_endpoint/fix-security-issue`

- **`release/`**: Preparation branches for new production releases
  - Example: `release/20241215-add-encryption-support`

### Branch Naming Format

Our repositories are organized as **monorepos**, containing multiple modules and stacks. Branch names must reference the specific component being modified to clearly identify the scope of changes.

Most branches follow the format: `<action>/<name>/<message>`

- `feature/az_storage_account/add-encryption-support`
- `bugfix/az_rbac_profile_assignment/fix-role-assignment`
- `feature/az_private_endpoint/add-service-integration`
- `bugfix/resource_group_stack/fix-rbac-assignment`
- `hotfix/storage_account_stack/fix-security-vulnerability`

Release branches follow a different format: `release/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-desc>`

- `release/20241215-add-encryption-support`
- `release/20241220-fix-rbac-issue`

### Branch Naming Best Practices

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for multi-word names
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include ticket numbers if your project uses them (e.g., `feature/TICKET-123-add-feature`)
- Avoid special characters and spaces

<Tip>
Consistent branch naming makes it easier to filter and search branches, and helps team members quickly understand the purpose of each branch.
