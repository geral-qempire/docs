Azure Storage Accounts provide secure, scalable cloud storage for your applications and data. This guide helps you understand the different options available when requesting a Storage Account.

<Tip>
This page explains the options you'll see in the Storage Account request form. For technical details about Azure Storage Accounts, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).
</Tip>

## Overview

When requesting a Storage Account, you'll need to make decisions about:

- **Availability & Disaster Recovery**: How protected your data needs to be (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)
- **Versioning**: Whether you need protection against accidental changes (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Whether to automatically optimize storage costs (Bronze/Off, Silver/On)
- **RBAC Profiles**: Who can read or modify your data (Full Access, Read Access)
- **Networking**: Whether to use private endpoints for secure access
- **Alerts**: What notifications you want to receive (Base, Blob, File, Queue)

## Tier Selection Guide

Use this quick reference to determine which tiers match your needs:

| Your Need | Availability Tier | Versioning Tier | Lifecycle Tier |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Development/Testing | Bronze | Bronze | Bronze |
| Standard Production | Silver | Silver | Silver |
| Critical Production | Gold | Gold | Silver |
| Mission-Critical | Platinum or Diamond | Platinum | Silver |
| Need version history | Any | Silver or higher | Any |
| Want cost optimization | Any | Any | Silver |
| Read access during outages | Diamond | Any | Any |

---

## Availability & Disaster Recovery

Choose a tier based on how critical your data is and how much protection you need against outages or data loss.

| Attribute | <Badge color="red">Bronze</Badge> | <Badge color="gray">Silver</Badge> | <Badge color="orange">Gold</Badge> | <Badge color="purple">Platinum</Badge> | <Badge color="blue">Diamond</Badge> |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|----------|---------|
| **Read SLA** | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.99% |
| **Write SLA** | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.9% |
| **Regional Outage RPO** | N/A | N/A | ≤ 15 min | ≤ 15 min | ≤ 15 min |
| **Regional Outage SLA** | N/A | N/A | N/A | 99% of month | 99% of month |
| **Read Access During Outage** | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Soft Delete** | 7d / 7d | 30d / 30d | 30d / 30d | 30d / 30d | 30d / 30d |

<Warning>
Platform RTO is not guaranteed. Recovery times depend on your application's runbooks and operational procedures.
</Warning>

## Versioning

Versioning helps you recover from accidental overwrites, deletions, data corruption, or malicious changes.

| Attribute | <Badge color="red">Bronze</Badge> | <Badge color="gray">Silver</Badge> | <Badge color="orange">Gold</Badge> | <Badge color="purple">Platinum</Badge> |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|----------|
| **Operational RPO** | N/A | Last change | Last change | Last change |
| **Operational RTO** | N/A | Minutes | Minutes | Minutes |
| **Version Retention** | N/A | 14 days | 30 days | 60 days (cool @30d, delete @60d) |

<Info>
**Versioning**: Creates a history of your files, allowing you to recover previous versions if files are accidentally modified or deleted.
</Info>

<Info>
**Operational RPO**: With versioning enabled, you can recover to the "last change" - meaning you can restore a file to exactly how it was before the most recent modification.
</Info>

<Info>
**Operational RTO**: The time it takes to locate and restore a previous version. This typically takes minutes but depends on your team's procedures.
</Info>

<Info>
**Version Retention**: How long previous versions are kept. After this period, old versions are automatically deleted.
</Info>

<Tip>
Enable versioning for any data that changes frequently or is critical to your business. The cost is minimal compared to the protection it provides.
</Tip>

## Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle management helps you save money on storage for old or rarely-used files while keeping them available if needed.

| Attribute | <Badge color="red">Bronze</Badge> | <Badge color="gray">Silver</Badge> |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Lifecycle Management** | Disabled | Enabled |
| **Hot → Cool Transition** | N/A | Move to Cool if not accessed for 30 days |
| **Cool → Cold Transition** | N/A | Move to Cold if not accessed for 90 days (from last access) |
| **Auto-Promote** | N/A | Automatically promote Cool → Hot on read |

<Tip>
Enable lifecycle management if you have data that's accessed frequently at first but then rarely used (like logs, backups, or archived documents).
</Tip>


For technical details, see the [Microsoft documentation on blob lifecycle management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview).

## RBAC Profiles

RBAC profiles determine what actions users, groups, or service accounts can perform. You'll provide the IDs of principals who should receive these permissions.

<Info>
**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Profiles that determine what actions users, groups, or service accounts can perform on your Storage Account.
</Info>

<Info>
For detailed technical descriptions of these roles, see the [Microsoft documentation on Azure built-in roles for storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal#azure-built-in-roles-for-storage).
</Info>

### Write Access
 Grants complete read and write access to all storage services.

- Storage Blob Data Reader
- Storage File Data SMB Share Reader

## Networking

Configure how your Storage Account can be accessed over the network.

### Private Endpoints

<Info>
**Private Endpoints**: Secure, private connectivity to your storage account services without traversing the public internet.
</Info>

Specify which private endpoints you need based on the Storage Account services you will use:

| Service | When to Enable |
|---------|----------------|
| **Blob** | Enable if you'll use blob containers to store files, images, or unstructured data |
| **File** | Enable if you'll use file shares (SMB/NFS) for shared file storage |
| **Queue** | Enable if you'll use queues for messaging between applications |
| **Table** | Enable if you'll use tables for NoSQL structured data storage |

### Allowed IP Addresses

Optionally, you can configure allowed public IPv4 addresses to enable public network access from specific IPs. If no IPs are provided, public network access is completely disabled.
